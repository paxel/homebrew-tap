  # and the file type go into ~/.local/share here, which every session reads. Homebrew
  # scrubs the environment first, so a custom XDG_DATA_HOME is not seen here; the
  # caveat names the helper for that case. A home that cannot be written (a container,
  # a bottle build) must not fail the install over a menu entry.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Needs the usual desktop libraries from your distribution: X11 or
      Wayland with libxkbcommon, and ALSA for the cheers
      (e.g. Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt install libxkbcommon0 libasound2t64).

      The install puts cat(a)log into your application menu, where it can also be
      pinned, and registers .catsync files, under ~/.local/share. If it is missing
      there, for another user on this machine, or with a custom XDG_DATA_HOME, run:

        catlog-install-icon

      Before brew uninstall, to take the menu entry out again:

        catlog-install-icon --uninstall
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_predicate libexec/"catlog", :exist?
  end
